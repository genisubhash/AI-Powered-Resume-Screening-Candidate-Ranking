# 🤖 AI Powered Resume Screening & Candidate Ranking System

An intelligent machine-learning based application that automatically analyzes resumes, predicts the best-fit job role, extracts technical skills, and produces a **candidate ranking score** to help recruiters shortlist applicants faster and more accurately.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ 1. Resume Classification  
Predicts the most suitable job category using:
- TF-IDF Vectorization  
- Logistic Regression Model  

### ✅ 2. Candidate Ranking Score  
A confidence score that represents how well the resume matches the predicted job category.

### ✅ 3. Automated Skill Extraction  
Identifies technical skills from the resume using keyword-based skill detection.

### ✅ 4. Required Skill Analysis  
Shows:
- ✔ Matched Skills  
- ❌ Missing Skills  
Based on predefined job-role skill requirements.

### ✅ 5. Optional: Job Description (JD) Matching  
If a JD is uploaded, the system provides:
- Skill Match %  
- Textual Similarity %  
- **ATS Compatibility Score** (70% skills + 30% similarity)

### ✅ 6. Fast & User-Friendly Interface  
Built with **Streamlit** for real-time predictions and a modern UI.

## 📝 How the Model Works

1. Extracts text from PDF/TXT resume  
2. Cleans text (removes special characters, lowercases, etc.)  
3. Converts resume into a TF-IDF vector  
4. Logistic Regression predicts job category  
5. Highest probability → Candidate Ranking Score  
6. Extracted skills are matched with expected skills for that category  
7. If JD provided → ATS Score (skill match + similarity)

## 🏋️ Training the Model

You can train your model from the app using:

### Dataset Format:
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Resume | Resume text |
| Category | Job role label |

### Steps:
1. Go to **Train Model** tab  
2. Upload your `.csv` file  
3. Click **Train Model**  
4. The trained model gets saved automatically (clf.pkl & tfidf.pkl)
